# Constitution of ADAO Community Association 

### Originally Adopted XXXXXXX

# Preamble

Mission Statement: As users of the Cardano network, the members of ADAO come together to form this organization that will serve our community.  Our founders come from different nations, with different identities, and different walks of life.  But we are brought together in our hope that decentralized technologies will allow us to cooperate in a more honest and more perfect union.

We seek to operate our organization according to the principles made manifest in blockchain technologies.  Our knowledge shall be shared, and our actions shall be auditable.  Our motivations shall be transparent, and our records shall be immutable.  We will provide a forum where all voices can be heard, and governance that ensures that the will of the whole shall be executed.  We will allow anyone to associate or disassociate freely while we collectively build tools for everyone to use.  The mantra of our organization shall be this unrelenting quest: Decentralization Together.

# Article I - Organization

**Section 1.1 - Status.**  ADAO Community Association (referred to in this agreement as “ADAO”) is an unincorporated nonprofit association under Wyo. Stat. Title 17, Ch. 22 of the laws of the State of Wyoming.

ADAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership. 

**Section 1.2 - Purposes.** As more fully stated in its Mission Statement (as may be updated from time to time via governance) ADAO is organized for the following purposes:  To share knowledge about what DAOs are and how to use them effectively. To develop tools for decentralized coordination and DAO governance on the blockchain. To offer technical, organizational, and financial support in designing and developing DAOs. 

**Section 1.3 - Not an Investment Company.** ADAO is not organized to provide financial services, advice, or investment opportunities. All the content developed by ADAO, with the exception of identifying materials, shall be placed in the public domain or under an open license depending upon the proper circumstances of the product.  ADAO projects and products should not be considered investments and no promises are made that they will hold any monetary value.  

**Section 1.4 - Cooperative principles.** ADAO shall be operated in the spirit of cooperative principles framed by the 1995 General Assembly of the International Co-operative Alliance, including: (i) voluntary and open membership; (ii) democratic member control through distributed ledger smart contract voting management; (iii) member economic participation; (iv) autonomy and independence of ADAO; (v) providing education, training and information; (vi) cooperation with other DAO cooperatives; and (vii) concern for community.

**Section 1.5 - Nondiscrimination.** ADAO shall not arbitrarily discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, or otherwise.  

**Section 1.6 - Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).** ADAO is a DAO, an unincorporated association of individuals, entities, associations and/or other persons or groups of persons who all agree to join together in a common purpose. For ADAO that purpose is encapsulated in our Mission Statement.

# Article II - Membership

**Section 2.1 - Eligibility** Membership shall be voluntary and application open to any individual of at least 18 years of age whose purpose or presumed intent is to contribute, to build, and to use the services of ADAO and is willing to accept the responsibilities and terms of membership. 

**Section 2.2 - Admission.** Membership in ADAO shall be granted to all members off the Cardano community. This is anyone who holds at least one (1) ADA token in a Cardano wallet with stake delegated to a stake pool operator.  There shall be no requirement to contribute time to ADAO projects or assets to the ADAO Treasury.

Members shall fall into one or more of the following categories:
1.	GovToken Holders are individuals who hold the ADAO Governance Token (ADAO).  GovToken Holders are responsible for deciding the priorities of the DAO through the proposal process.  No assets may be moved out of the DAO treasury without a vote of GovToken Holders and all program coordination is formalized through votes on proposals.
2.	Active Contributors are community volunteers who dedicate their time to DAO projects or working groups.  Individuals who contribute can claim bounties from the DAO treasury and use any GovTokens they receive to vote on what projects the DAO should work on next.
3.	Community Associates are any member of the Cardano community who chooses to associate with ADAO.  Even if an individual does not yet hold any GovTokens they can engage in legitimate peripheral participation by engaging in community discussions to help guide DAO efforts

**Section 2.3 - Rights.** ADAO Members shall utilize the “Designated Smart Contract” (a smart contract deployed to the Cardano Blockchain at the Designated Blockchain Address as the exclusive method of holding, allocating among the ADAO Members, and spending, or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are ADAO property, of minting and issuing GovTokens and holding and recording votes of the ADAO Members. ADAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving ADAO, the ADAO Members and/or third parties. 

ADAO Members’ rights and responsibilities are controlled by the use of the Designated Smart Contact used to conduct its governance and ADAO activities. ADAO’s Cardano Agent is the Designated Smart Contract that holds the UTXO containing the ADAO Identity NFT, Cardano Policy ID: XXXXXXXXXXXX.

This Designated Smart Contract shall contain the rules of ADAO governance to act on behalf of the DAO, and to contract on behalf of the DAO through ADAO membership vote. ADAO members will cast votes and carry out the decisions made on the Designated Smart Contract as well as any Ancillary Smart Contracts that are generated by the Designated Smart Contract.

**Section 2.4 - Responsibilities.** By accepting and retaining membership each applicant shall agree to use the products or services of ADAO on at least an occasional basis. Each member shall keep reasonably current on the state of the DAO by reviewing correspondence from the ADAO social media channels or connecting with other ADAO members in the designated collaboration platforms. Members also agree to abide by the standards of professional conduct as outlined in the ADAO Handbook.

If you have received any ADAO tokens or are otherwise a DAO Member, you consent to contact and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both an ADAO participant and more specifically an "ADAO Member". 

**Section 2.5 - Limitations.**  Status as an ADAO Member does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and the ADAO Membership Rights do not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of an ADAO Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of ADAO or any other ADAO Member, to bind ADAO or any other ADAO Member to any Contract or Liability or to convey any ADAO property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of ADAO or any ADAO Member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no ADAO Member shall be deemed the partner of ADAO or any other ADAO Member. No ADAO Member shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent to any person that such ADAO Member or any other ADAO Member has any such authority, right or power. 

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no ADAO Member shall be (or shall be deemed to be) liable for any liability of the ADAO or any other ADAO Member. This shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of ADAO or any ADAO Member to indemnify or compensate any ADAO Member from, or hold any ADAO Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such DAO Member under any applicable law, in connection with the ADAO Member's participation in ADAO or otherwise. 

**Section 2.6 - Inactive status.** A member who falls from good standing may have their membership revoked or suspended through the vote of ADAO Membership (each said action, a “Member Removal”). References herein to the rights and entitlements of members shall be understood to refer only to members in good standing. 

**Section 2.7 - Access to information.** Members shall have access to information concerning the operational and financial affairs of via the Treasury application of the organization. Currently the ADAO treasury can be viewed via Designated Smart Contract. 

**Section 2.8 - Settlement of disputes.** In any dispute between ADAO and any of its members or former members which cannot be resolved through informal negotiation, it shall be the policy of ADAO to prefer the use of mediation whereby an impartial mediator may facilitate negotiations between the parties and assist them in developing a mutually acceptable settlement. Neither party with a grievance against the other shall have recourse to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted to be resolved in good faith. All ADAO Membership agree that there is a preference to settle disputes amongst members or between members and ADAO via decentralized dispute mechanisms via smart contract protocols. 

**Section  2.9 - Transferability of Membership.** Membership rights and interests may be transferred by token exchange.

**Section 2.10 - Withdrawal and Expulsion.** A member may withdraw at any time by divesting themselves of all ADAO Tokens and publicly declaring, through a Cardano Transaction Comment made by their wallet, that they are formally disassociating.  

A member may be expelled by ADAO through the Member Removal procedure established in section 2.6 of this document and adopted by the membership. Upon termination of membership, all rights and interests in ADAO shall cease except for rights to redemption of capital pursuant to Article V below (if any). 

# Article III - Meetings of Members

**Section 3.1 - Meetings.** Meetings of members shall be described on a basis at the discretion of its membership on the ADAO Discord Server.

**Section 3.2 - Special meetings.** Special meetings of members may be called by a designated advisory group (the “ADAO Core Contributors”). The ADAO Core Contributors group is not required and may be created or disbanded according to the will of the ADAO members. Creation and Designation of the ADAO Core Contributors will be approved via the Designated Smart Contract.  Core Contributors shall retain their status until such time that it expires, is revoked, or they resign from the role.

**Section 3.3 -Time and place.** The date, time and place of all meetings of the ADAO Core Contributors shall be determined by the ADAO Core Contributors group or, in the event that the ADAO Core Contributors group fails to act, by a call for vote via the GovToken Holders. 

**Section 3.4 - Notice.** The membership is responsible for monitoring votes of concern on the Designated Smart Contract. Notice of votes can be set up by GovToken Holders via the Designated Smart Contract and when votes are triggered in the ADAO Discord Server. Notices of meetings shall also be posted on ADAO’s official social media and the ADAO Discord Server including the member information roster, but the inadvertent failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the meeting. Any business conducted at a meeting of members other than that specified in the notice of the meeting shall be of an advisory nature only. 

**Section 3.5 - Quorum.** The ADAO Handbook (“Handbook”) shall provide a written explanation of the voting mechanism and voting quorum requirements of ADAO. All actions using a software agent, (e.g. Cardano script), Treasury, membership and voting are governed by the Designated Smart Contract. 

**Section 3.6 - Voting.** All voting will be performed on chain according to the mechanisms established by the Designated Smart Contract and any Ancillary Smart Contracts that may be established by the Designated Smart Contract.  Records of votes shall be recorded on the Designated Blockchain.  Any vote, poll, or call for consensus that is taken in the ADAO Discord Server, ADAO social media accounts, or any other place shall be considered non-binding and advisory in nature.

 # Article IV - Decentralized Governance

**Section 4.1 - Powers and duties.** Except as to matters reserved to members by law or by this constitution, all ADAO powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of GovToken Holders or such agents or designees approved by GovToken Holders through Designated Smart Contract voting.

**Section 5.1 - Issuance and terms.** It is noted that different Designated Smart Contracts have different manners of managing governance shares (“GovToken”) versus contributed capital and efforts resulting in retains to ADAO (“Treasury Shares”). Currently, ADAO members have no rights of redemption of any working capital, or token assets, held within ADAO. No redemption may be offered without revision to the Designated Smart Contract and an amendment to this Constitution. 
XXXXXXX DO WE NEED TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THE DESIGNATED SMART CONTRACT IS ALLOWED TO BUY BACK ADAO TOKENS IN EXCHANGE FOR ASSETS IN THE TREASURY IF WE WISH? XXXXXXX

It is not anticipated that ADAO will ever turn a “profit” as excess capital will be paid out via charitable donations, grants, or other forms of support meant to carry out the Mission Statement.

In order to uphold these standards ADAO Core Contributors shall appoint ADAO account moderators who will be empowered to ban accounts from the Discord Server and block accounts on social media platforms.  While banned or blocked, GovToken Holders are still eligible to vote on proposals through the Designated Smart Contract.  If an individual wishes to have a banned or blocked account reinstated to good standing with ADAO they may appeal to the moderator(s) who banned them or submit a proposal to the Designated Smart Contract asking the ADAO Membership to override the ban.

# Article VII - Patronage Dividends. XXXXXX DO WE NEED THIS SECTION? XXXXXX

**Section 7.1 - Distribution obligation.** The realized net earnings of LexDAO attributable to the patronage of members through contributions and voting shall be allocated and distributed among members in proportion to their patronage and in such a manner and at such a time as to constitute patronage dividends within the meaning of federal income tax law. Unless otherwise required under federal tax law all of the operations of the LexDAO shall be netted into a single allocation unit.

**Section 7.2 - Reductions.** Any distributable net earnings of such a nominal amount as not to justify the expenses of distribution may, as determined by the LexDAO Advisory Group pr LDC Members, be excluded from distribution. Net earnings may be reduced by such reasonable reserves for necessary business purposes as is determined by the LexDAO Advisory Group or LDC Members. A patronage dividend to which members are entitled may be waived in whole or in part by vote of members.

**Section 7.3 - Consent of members.** By obtaining or retaining membership in LexDAO, each member shall there by consent to take into account, in the manner and to the extent required by Section 1385 of the Internal Revenue Code, the stated dollar amount of any qualified written notice of allocation in the taxable year in which such notice is received.

**Section 7.4 - Deferred amounts.** Payment of patronage dividends may be deferred for the reasonable capital needs of LexDAO, as determined by LDC Members. Such amounts shall accrue no dividend or other monetary return on capital. Deferred patronage dividends may be redeemed when determined by LDC Members to be no longer needed for capital purposes. 

**Section 7.5 - Net losses.** No portion of a net operating loss realized by the Cooperative shall be allocated to members. The patronage portion of such losses shall be carried forward to offset patronage-sourced income of subsequent years. The non patronage portion of such losses shall be carried back and forward to offset non patronage-sourced income of prior and subsequent years as required or permitted under federal income tax law. As a nonprofit unincorporated association, it is not anticipated there will be tax returns or profits.

**Section 7.6 - Failure to Claim or Redeem.** The patronage dividend distributed to any member, by any means, including as cash, as a voucher, or by digital asset may be used for the purchase of LexDAO items and services, or donated to LexDAO.
